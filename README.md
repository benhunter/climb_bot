# [u/climb_bot on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/climb_bot)
climb_bot posts links to rock climbing routes and areas on [MountainProject.com](https://www.mountainproject.com). climb_bot is monitoring the subreddits [r/climbing](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbing) and [r/test](https://www.reddit.com/r/test). climb_bot searches MountainProject for the closest match and links to it, so partial information can often still give a relevant reply.

If climb_bot can't find a match, it won't post a reply at all. Comments that have not been replied to by climb_bot can be edited and climb_bot will keep attempting to find a link. But once a climb_bot replies, it won't look at that comment again.

### Commands
climb_bot looks for the command 'climb:' or '!climb' in comments. adding the keyword 'area' searches for areas on MountainProject. Examples:
* Climb: The Nose, Yosemite
* climb: The Nose, Yosemite
* !Climb The Nose, Yosemite
* !climb The Nose, Yosemite
* climb: area Yosemite Valley
* !climb area Yosemite Valley
